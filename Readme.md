Quoted from our website:

>Where you can set records without setting down your drink.
>Oddballâ€™s sports are a little off-center, leaving room in the spotlight for the community.
>Most of these sports are old-old, but their histories have been largely buried or unwritten. Oddball Sports is where the legends will be made and remembered.

## Who is Obie?

Obie is OddballSports' cute little mascot with two eyes.  Our application is called "obies-eyes" because OddballSports courts are getting eyes in the form of cameras.

# Oddball Sports Vision Overview

Also known as (aka): Obie's Eyes.

Obie is getting an upgrade with cameras. We're building technology for games and sports using Computer Vision and Software for Scoring, Statistics, and Production Video.
